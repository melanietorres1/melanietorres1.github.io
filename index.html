        <p class="lead mb-4">I currently work as a Program Leader. I work with a designated group of students and offer them a variety of forms of assistance. I am responsible for planning and directing each activity, including physical and enrichment activities. I also have to be a model of safety, positivity, and enthusiasm for the students. I work directly with 3rd and 4th-grade students, some of my students have mild to moderate disabilities. Although I am not trained in working with students with disabilities, I make sure to foster a trusting and safe relationship between all my students, especially my students who have disabilities. Luckily, for those students who have disabilities, I have had the opportunity to be their program leader since they were in 1st grade, as they moved up in grades, I moved up with them. I have been able to learn what works best for them and what they need to feel comfortable. Although I have a primary interest in primary school, I have also worked with middle school students. My responsibilities were the same but I had to treat my middle school students more like an equal to create a trusting relationship. 
 In the summer of 2023, I worked as a sleepaway camp counselor for Girl Scouts. I served as a positive role model and mentor for campers. Provided guidance, encouragement, and support to help campers develop new skills, build confidence, and resolve conflicts. I worked collaboratively with fellow counselors and camp staff to create a cohesive and supportive team environment. Shared ideas, participated in staff meetings, and contributed to the overall success of the camp. Lastly, I organized, led, and participated in a variety of camp activities and programs. During my time at this camp, I was primarily responsible for kids in the age range from 7-10, I also had the opportunity to help guide and offer advice to the older camps. During their lunch and dinner times, the counselors were advised to sit at a table with different campers to build relationships with other campers. This opportunity allowed me to work with campers of all ages.
 <br><br>

As far as my university involvement goes, I am a part of Alpha Chi Omega and hold leadership positions. In my first year, I served as the Assistant recruitment information. I assist in training members in Alpha Chi Omegaâ€™s five membership standards. I planned and supervised the membership selection process and maintained communication with the executive board to ensure smooth operation. I currently am the VP of Philanthropy, I inform my chapter of volunteer opportunities, as well as reach out to different organizations to partner with them in creating volunteer opportunities for my chapter. I create events to raise awareness of our philanthropy which is, domestic violence awareness, and to advocate for DVA. I also create events to raise money for our philanthropy. 
<br><br>
      I was also involved in my community. I served as the Co-commissioner of the 2nd District Youth Advisory Council. I Created monthly council reports attended all Commission meetings, and discussed all available volunteer opportunities at council meetings. I also maintained excellent communication with council officers to ask any questions allowing for smooth operations
